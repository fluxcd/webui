# Flux Web UI

## Project Status

:warning: This project is currently **on hold**, because the maintainers do not have capacity to
develop it further at present. We (the Flux project) will try to keep it up to date with the Flux
APIs so it will still run, but it will remain experimental and may not always work (please file an
issue if you find it does not work!).

Please get in touch in [#flux-contributors](https://slack.cncf.io/) if you are interested in helping
to get this project moving again.

See [the monitoring section of the Flux documentation](https://fluxcd.io/docs/guides/monitoring/)
for how to install Flux's Grafana dashboards.
